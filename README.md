# ScriptHookDotNet-for-IVSDKDotNet
GTA IV ScriptHookDotNet from HazardX with a IV-SDK .NET translation layer on-top to make mods created with ScriptHookDotNet work with IV-SDK .NET!

### Currently in development!

## Limitations / Bugs
There might be things which are not yet implemented, mods that simply crash the game or other weird bugs.
Please open up a new issue in the [issues page](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/ScriptHookDotNet-for-IVSDKDotNet/issues) with the mod that you are having trouble with, the error the mod might be spitting out and a basic steps to reproduce this problem section.

## Requirements
- [IV-SDK .NET](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/IV-SDK-DotNet) (Version 1.2 or above)
- And... ScriptHookDotNet mods i guess
