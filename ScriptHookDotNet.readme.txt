2. Requirements
---------------

- IV-SDK .NET Version 1.2 or above
https://gtaforums.com/topic/986510-iv-sdk-net

IV-SDK .NET has additional requirements. So make sure you read through them aswell.


3. Installation
---------------

FIRST OF ALL: You need IV-SDK .NET version 1.2 or above!

- You already have ScriptHookDotNet?
First you should make sure that you REMOVE the already installed "ScriptHookDotNet.asi" AND "ScriptHookDotNet.dll" file!
After you've done this, you can copy the new ScriptHookDotNet.dll into your main directory of GTA IV.
The scripts that you got installed should now use the modified ScriptHookDotNet.dll and run through IV-SDK .NET.

- First time installing ScriptHookDotNet?
Well then you just have to copy the "ScriptHookDotNet.dll" into your main directory of GTA IV!
If you also want to start install scripts you should also create a new folder in your main directory called "scripts"


4. Script Installation
----------------------

Scripts for ScriptHookDotNet have to be copied into the "scripts" folder inside the main directory of GTA IV.
You may have to create the folder if it is not there.

ScriptHookDotNet scripts may have one of the following file formats:
 *.net      - for compiled scripts in any .NET language
 *.net.dll  - for compiled scripts in any .NET language

WARNING: Plain script files like *.vb or *.cs will not be supported!


5. Deinstallation
-----------------

To remove IV-SDK .NET, you will have to delete the "IVSDKDotNet.asi", "IVSDKDotNetWrapper.dll" and the "IVSDKDotNet" folder inside your main directory of GTA IV.

Scripts contained in the "scripts" folder can remain there
if you wish to keep them. They wont run or interfere with the
game when "IVSDKDotNet.asi" is deleted.


6. Known Issues
---------------

Not all script functions have been tested. Some of them may not work as desired or may even lead to crashes!
If you experience any crashes or got any script errors from your ScriptHookDotNet scripts, then please report them here: https://github.com/ClonkAndre/ScriptHookDotNet-for-IVSDKDotNet/issues
